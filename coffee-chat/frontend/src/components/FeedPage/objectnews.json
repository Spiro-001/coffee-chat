              "content": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell on the Dec. 9 Wall Street open as United States economic data appeared to disappoint markets. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dipping to come closer to $17,000 after passing the level overnight. The pair reacted badly to U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which despite being above expectations still beat the readout from the month prior. “Bit of an over reaction towards PPI, which has been dropping significantly from last month, but less than expected,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, responded . Van de Poppe, like others, noted that the crux of macro cues would come next week in the form of Consumer Price Index (CPI) print for November. “CPI next week is the big trigger, just like it was earlier this month,” he added. CPI could be a seminal point, trading firm QCP Capital continued, as if it were to continue its downward trend, markets may get an even stronger conviction over lower inflation greeting the new year. The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting days later, where policymakers decide on interest rate hikes, should add fuel to the fire. “Tuesday’s CPI will yet again be ‘the most important CPI release ever’, this time because the market has set it up to be with its epic 2-month short squeeze rally,” QCP wrote in a market update on the day. Analysts acknowledged that if CPI were to disappoint, it would potentially “invalidate” the stocks rally so far. A 50-basis-point rate hike had a 77% probability of occurring, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool . U.S. equities were flat after the first hour's trading, with PPI failing to make a significant dent in performance. Related: GBTC 'elevator to hell' sees Bitcoin spot price approach 100% premium For macro economist and stocks analyst James Choi, this was to be expected, given that the Fed was already considering decreasing the pace of its rate hikes. \"The FED already pivoted its course. Today's PPI won't make a dent to Powell's plan. It's 50bp next week, then that's it,\" he forecast , also saying that his calculations predicted a \"much, much lower\" CPI reading than many believed. Meanwhile, U.S. dollar strength also simmered, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) attempting to make up for the previous day's lost ground on the back of PPI.

              "content": "Cryptocurrency trading firm Amber Group is putting its expansion plans on hold despite the FTX contagion having “no disruption” to its daily operations, according to a senior executive. Amber has scrapped plans to expand in Europe and the United States as a consequence of exposure to the now-defunct exchange FTX and will focus on institutional clients in Asia, according to managing partner Annabelle Huang. Huang also said that Amber has been forced to deprioritize its new metaverse project due the FTX contagion, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 9. Apart from ditching its expansion plans, the firm has reportedly been cutting its headcount recently. After reportedly laying off up to 40% of staff in September, the firm continued to lay off employees again in December. According to Huang, Amber had roughly 10% of its trading capital stuck on FTX, which is not an issue for the company’s daily operations. In line with its plans to continue servicing customers in Asia, Amber has continued working to raise new funding and make new acquisitions. The Temasek-backed company has raised about $50 million in funding from a new sovereign fund, with the deal to be announced in January. Similar to Amber’s previous $200 million round , the new funding values the firm at $3 billion. The raised amount is twice as low as what Amber originally expected to secure. Amber doesn’t consider its ongoing raise to be unsuccessful, Huang said. “We are not under pressure to raise capital,” she noted, adding that Amber will also announce a major acquisition of a licensed Singaporean business in December. Related: Amber Group’s co-founder Tiantian Kullander passes away at 30 The news comes shortly after Huang denied allegations of Amber’s insolvency. The exec took to Twitter on Dec. 6 to respond to allegations that Amber was “on the verge of bankruptcy,” stating: The allegations were made by on-chain analyst Lookonchain, who detected some significant discrepancies between wallets allegedly owned by Amber and the reported funds and trading volumes.",

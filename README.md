# Coffee Chat [ LinkedIn Clone ]
Hello World! Welcome to Coffee Chat, a LinkedIn clone.

I decided to make LinkedIn because I was interested in a social media application. My plan is to extended my project and
create my own social media application. This was a good introduction to web development and hope to make better coding practices. In this project I included a user auth with proper error handling. Handling such as checking if account exist phone number validations, email validations, and all of it is rendered to the user.
